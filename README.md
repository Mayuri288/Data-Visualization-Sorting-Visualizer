The Data Visualization Sorting Visualizer is a project that demonstrates various sorting algorithms using interactive data visualizations

This project includes the following sorting algorithms:

Bubble sort
Selection sort
Insertion sort
Merge sort
Quick sort

The Data Visualization Sorting Visualizer project uses the World Happiness Report dataset to create visualizations that show how sorting algorithms work on real-world data. Specifically, the project reads in the data from the World Happiness Report and uses it to generate a random array of data that represents the happiness levels of people in different countries. The project then visualizes how the selected sorting algorithm sorts this data.

React and D3 are both used in this project to create the interactive data visualizations.
